There is no perfect recipe for capturing the northern lights because, as in any situation, 
your exposure will largely depend on the light. However, that being said, try setting you camera on full manual mode. 
Use the Live View setting on your camera’s display to ensure you get a sharp focus at infinity 
  (or slightly less, depending on the lens). 
  
* Set your ISO between 800 and 3200
* aperture between f/2.8 and f/5.6, 
* shutter speed at between 15 seconds and 30 seconds.

in slight star movement. You’re ready. Lock you mirror up, compose, and shoot. If you end up with a slightly overexposed
or underexposed image, play with a combinations of these settings until you get the exposure to where you want it.
